#Some sample codes  
This repository contains some crude sample codes I have written. These codes are not well commented as most of these were written for coding competitions with time constraints.  

##Usage  
Clone the repository / download / copy respective files and update the package name on first line to your project package name. You can then run any of the java files in the standard way (IDE or cmd).
